To generate the van der Waals (vdW) surface for a small molecule, based on the 3D coordinates of its atoms and their vdW radii, you can follow this algorithm:

### Inputs:
- A list of **N** atoms, each defined by their coordinates \((x_i, y_i, z_i)\) and their vdW radius \(d_i\).
- The grid spacing **g** (the resolution of the grid points).

### Steps:

1. **Define the grid boundaries:**
   - First, determine the bounding box that will enclose all atoms. This box is determined by the minimum and maximum x, y, and z values of the atomic coordinates, plus the vdW radius of each atom.
     \[
     x_{\text{min}} = \min(x_i) - d_i, \quad x_{\text{max}} = \max(x_i) + d_i
     \]
     \[
     y_{\text{min}} = \min(y_i) - d_i, \quad y_{\text{max}} = \max(y_i) + d_i
     \]
     \[
     z_{\text{min}} = \min(z_i) - d_i, \quad z_{\text{max}} = \max(z_i) + d_i
     \]
   - This creates a box that encompasses all atoms with an extra margin corresponding to their vdW radii.

2. **Generate the grid points:**
   - Create a 3D grid with points spaced by \(g\) along the x, y, and z axes.
   - Each point \((x_g, y_g, z_g)\) in this grid can be generated as:
     \[
     x_g = x_{\text{min}} + i \cdot g \quad \text{for} \quad i = 0, 1, \dots, \left\lfloor \frac{x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}}{g} \right\rfloor
     \]
     \[
     y_g = y_{\text{min}} + j \cdot g \quad \text{for} \quad j = 0, 1, \dots, \left\lfloor \frac{y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}}}{g} \right\rfloor
     \]
     \[
     z_g = z_{\text{min}} + k \cdot g \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, \dots, \left\lfloor \frac{z_{\text{max}} - z_{\text{min}}}{g} \right\rfloor
     \]

3. **Check if each grid point is inside the vdW surface:**
   - For each grid point \((x_g, y_g, z_g)\), calculate its distance to each atom \(i\):
     \[
     d_{\text{grid-atom}} = \sqrt{(x_g - x_i)^2 + (y_g - y_i)^2 + (z_g - z_i)^2}
     \]
   - If this distance is less than or equal to the vdW radius \(d_i\) of atom \(i\), then the grid point is considered to be inside or on the vdW surface of that atom:
     \[
     d_{\text{grid-atom}} \leq d_i
     \]
   - If the grid point satisfies this condition for **any** atom, it is considered part of the vdW surface.

4. **Return the grid points:**
   - Collect all grid points that are part of the vdW surface and return them as the result.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def generate_vdw_surface(atom_coordinates, vdw_radii, grid_spacing):
    # Unpack atom coordinates and vdw radii
    N = len(atom_coordinates)
    x_coords = [atom[0] for atom in atom_coordinates]
    y_coords = [atom[1] for atom in atom_coordinates]
    z_coords = [atom[2] for atom in atom_coordinates]
    
    # Determine grid boundaries
    x_min = min(x_coords) - max(vdw_radii)
    x_max = max(x_coords) + max(vdw_radii)
    y_min = min(y_coords) - max(vdw_radii)
    y_max = max(y_coords) + max(vdw_radii)
    z_min = min(z_coords) - max(vdw_radii)
    z_max = max(z_coords) + max(vdw_radii)
    
    # Generate grid points
    grid_points = []
    for x in frange(x_min, x_max, grid_spacing):
        for y in frange(y_min, y_max, grid_spacing):
            for z in frange(z_min, z_max, grid_spacing):
                for i in range(N):
                    # Check distance from current grid point to atom i
                    distance = sqrt((x - x_coords[i])**2 + (y - y_coords[i])**2 + (z - z_coords[i])**2)
                    if distance <= vdw_radii[i]:
                        grid_points.append((x, y, z))
                        break  # Once inside an atom's vdW radius, no need to check others
    return grid_points
```

### Key points:
- The `frange` function is used to generate floating-point ranges similar to `range()`.
- The `vdw_radii` is a list of van der Waals radii for each atom, which can be obtained from a reference table (e.g., from Wikipedia).

This algorithm will produce a set of grid points that lie on or inside the van der Waals surface of the molecule, effectively giving you a 3D representation of the surface.
