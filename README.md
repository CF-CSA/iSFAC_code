# iSFAC_code
Code used in the preparation of the Manuscript on iSFAC modelling
- Rscat contains a python script to compute Rscat (Yonekura et al, IUCrJ (2018), 5, 348-353 https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252518005237)
- pearson_coefficient contains a python script to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between sets of partial charges
- tutorials contains a video on how to create and use SFAC command for SHELXL, both for ionic and neutral atoms. Unfortunately, the volume of this video is very low
- cubemaps contains incomplete code for reading files and computing their Pearson correlation coefficient. Cube maps can be on different grids.
